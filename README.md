# Instafilter
Instafilter is an app that helps the user to edit photos by applying different filters to them. With support from Paul Hudson.

## Description
The goal of the project is to create an application using UIKit, which has already been developed using SwiftUI in the Hacking with Swift course. Paul Hudson created the same project using different frameworks, which was very helpful for my knowledge. Additionally, I have added a second screen on my own and rewritten the user interface (UI) implementation from Storyboard to programmatic implementation.
